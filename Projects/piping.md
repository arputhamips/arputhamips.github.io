## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Industry** | Hydrocarbon refining & chemical processing |
| **Primary Tools** | AutoCAD 2D, Navisworks, Aveva® E3D |
| **Codes & Standards** | ASME B31.3 / B31.4, API, IOCL specs |
| **Pipelines Modelled** | **300 +** (process, utility & flare) |
| **Field Exposure** | 3 months on‑site – PTA unit, Paradip (OD) |
| **Delivery** | 100 % spool installation on schedule |

## 1 — Scope & Objectives  
At **Technip Energies** I spent the first six months in the Chennai engineering office, where I led layout engineering for the **Paradeep Phosphates Ltd. (SAP‑D Sulphuric Acid Plant)** revamp, followed by a skeleton‑team *pTBC* rejuvenation study for a Lyon‑based client, before being mobilised to Paradip for three months to support spool fabrication and erection on a new **PTA (Para‑Terephthalic Acid) unit**.

**Primary Projects**
* **SAP‑D Sulphuric Acid Plant – Paradeep Phosphates Ltd.** (Chennai design hub) – Lead piping modeller & route optimiser.  
* **pTBC Mixing Automation – Lyon, France** (skeleton team) – Sole 3 D modeller; study to prevent popcorn polymerisation.  
* **PTA Green‑field Unit – Paradip, Odisha** (site) – Field engineer for spool fit‑up, welding & hydro‑testing.

* design economical pipe routes that **balanced safety, accessibility and thermal‑stress control**;  
* generate plot plans & unit plot plans to integrate new equipment;  
* drive **zero‑rework** construction by coordinating directly with vendors and site teams.

## 2 — Key Responsibilities  

1. **3D/2D Layout Engineering**  
   * Produced isometrics, GA drawings and support schedules for >300 lines. across SAP‑D and pTBC scopes.  
   * Integrated vendor models, clash‑checked with existing plant, and issued IFC packages.

2. **Field Engineering & Construction Support**  
   * Spent **90 days on‑site at the PTA build**: verified fit‑ups, resolved RFIs, and cleared hydro‑test loops.  
   * Managed subcontractor crews, sequencing lifts and spool erection to meet a compressed shutdown window.

3. **Compliance & QA/QC**  
   * Checked every line class against ASME, client and statutory requirements.  
   * Implemented punch‑list tracking that cut re‑work hours by **15 %**.

## 3 — Challenges & Solutions  

| Challenge | How I Tackled It |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Thermal growth on long crude lines** | Introduced cold‑spring offsets & guided‑anchor scheme; validated in Caesar II. |
| **Congested rack** | Applied multi‑level sleeper concept, freeing 18 % space for future expansion. |
| **Tight shutdown** | Pre‑fabricated 80 % of spools; developed colour‑coded erection maps to hit daily targets. |

---

## 4 — Outcomes & Impact  

* **100 %** of spools installed within the 3‑month shutdown.  
* Zero recordable safety incidents on piping scope.  
* Layout concept adopted as the new standard for subsequent units at the Paradip complex.
* Delivered brown‑field layouts that enabled automated pTBC dosing, eliminating “popcorn” risk in the client’s tank farm.

## 5 — Takeaways  

> Hands‑on time in the field is irreplaceable. Seeing installers wrestle with a heavy spool in cramped space reshaped the way I draw every elbow and support.
